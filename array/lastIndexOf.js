// The lastIndexOf() method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, 
// or -1 if it is not present. The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex.

const exarr = ["Apple","Banana","Grapes","Butter Milk"];

const arrval = exarr.lastIndexOf("Banana");
console.log(arrval);

// Expected output;
// 1;
